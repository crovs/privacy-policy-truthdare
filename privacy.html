        <h1>Privacy Policy for Truth or Dare - Spicy Party</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 14, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Truth or Dare - Spicy Party (the "App"), a mobile application created by Ahmet Emin Yada (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the App.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Content Advisory:</strong> Please be aware that the App offers a variety of categories, including some with truths and dares intended for mature audiences (e.g., 18+). Users are responsible for selecting categories appropriate for themselves and their fellow players.</p>

        <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our App is designed to be a fun, local experience. We collect minimal information, and most of it stays directly on your device.</p>

        <h3>a) Information You Provide Directly:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Player Names:</strong> When you add players to the game, their names are stored locally on your device. We do not transmit these names to our servers or any third party.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Categories, Truths, and Dares:</strong> If you create custom categories, truths, or dares, this content is stored locally on your device using your device's standard storage mechanisms (e.g., UserDefaults). This data is not transmitted to us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b) Automatically Collected Information (Usage Data):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Settings such as "Sound Effects Enabled" and "Haptics Enabled" are stored locally on your device using <code>AppStorage</code> to remember your preferences for future sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Interaction Data (Managed by Apple):</strong> As with most apps distributed through the App Store, Apple may collect anonymous, aggregated data regarding app usage, crashes, and performance. This information is governed by Apple's own privacy policies and helps us understand how the App is performing and identify issues. We do not receive personally identifiable information through this process.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription and Purchase Information (Managed via RevenueCat):</strong> If you subscribe to premium features or make in-app purchases, we use RevenueCat to manage these transactions. RevenueCat may collect or receive information necessary to process and validate your purchases, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>A unique User ID (generated by RevenueCat or provided by us) to track your subscription status and purchase history.</li>
                    <li>Transaction receipts from Apple.</li>
                    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IDFV) may be used by RevenueCat for subscription management and analytics purposes.</li>
                </ul>
                We do not directly access or store your sensitive payment details like credit card numbers; all payment processing is handled by Apple through the App Store. Please refer to RevenueCat's Privacy Policy (available at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a>) for more details on their data handling practices.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c) Information We DO NOT Collect (unless specified above):</h3>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or have access to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identifiers beyond player names entered by you or identifiers used by RevenueCat for purchase management.</li>
            <li>Your device's advertising identifier (IDFA).</li>
            <li>Your location data.</li>
            <li>Your contacts or photos.</li>
            <li>Sensitive payment information such as credit card numbers or bank details (payment processing is handled by Apple).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Operate the App:</strong> To allow you to play the game, manage player lists, and use custom categories.</li>
            <li><strong>To Save Your Preferences:</strong> To remember your settings for sound and haptics.</li>
            <li><strong>To Manage Subscriptions and In-App Purchases:</strong> To process transactions, validate access to premium features, and manage your subscription status through RevenueCat.</li>
            <li><strong>To Maintain and Improve the App:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized crash data or usage statistics provided by Apple, and potentially by RevenueCat (for purchase-related analytics), help us identify bugs and improve the user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We prioritize your privacy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Sale of Personal Information:</strong> We do not sell your personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Player names and custom content are stored on your device and are not shared with us or any third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share limited information with third-party vendors who assist us in providing the App’s functionality. These include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Apple:</strong> For app distribution, processing in-app purchases, and providing standard analytics.</li>
                    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For managing subscriptions, in-app purchases, and related analytics. RevenueCat has its own privacy policy (available at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a>) that governs its use of data. We encourage you to review it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent fraud, or protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>The data you provide (player names, custom categories) is stored locally on your device. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information (by relying on the device's security), please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee its absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Data Choices and Rights</h2>
        <p>Since most data is stored locally on your device, you have direct control over it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Player Names:</strong> You can delete players from the game at any time within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Categories:</strong> You can delete custom categories you have created. The "Reset Custom Categories" option in the App's settings allows you to remove all custom content you've added.</li>
            <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> You can change your sound and haptic preferences in the App's settings at any time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., if you are in the European Economic Area (EEA)), you may have additional rights such as the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal information. As we do not typically store personal information about you on our servers, please contact us if you have questions about data that might be indirectly processed (e.g., through Apple's services).</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is intended for a general audience but includes content suitable for mature users (e.g., 18 and older). While the App may offer categories that are generally family-friendly, other categories contain adult themes. The App is not directed at children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold if required by applicable law in your jurisdiction, such as 16 in the EEA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
        <p>If you are a parent or guardian, we strongly advise you to guide your children's use of the App and ensure that they only access categories appropriate for their age. By allowing a minor to use this app, you acknowledge that they may be exposed to content intended for adults if appropriate category selections are not made. If you believe that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.</p>

        <h2>7. Links to Other Sites (Terms of Use & Rate App)</h2>
        <p>Our App contains links to our Terms of Use and the App Store for rating the app. These sites are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
