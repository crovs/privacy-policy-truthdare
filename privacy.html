        <h1>Privacy Policy for Truth or Dare - Spicy Party</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 14, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Truth or Dare - Spicy Party (the "App"), a mobile application created by Ahmet Emin Yada (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the App.</p>
        
        <!-- ADDED CONTENT ADVISORY -->
        <p><strong>Content Advisory:</strong> Please be aware that the App offers a variety of categories, including some with truths and dares intended for mature audiences (e.g., 18+). Users are responsible for selecting categories appropriate for themselves and their fellow players.</p>

        <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <!-- ... (Sections 1-5 remain the same) ... -->

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <!-- MODIFIED SECTION -->
        <p>Our App is intended for a general audience but includes content suitable for mature users (e.g., 18 and older). While the App may offer categories that are generally family-friendly, other categories contain adult themes. The App is not directed at children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold if required by applicable law in your jurisdiction, such as 16 in the EEA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
        <p>If you are a parent or guardian, we strongly advise you to guide your children's use of the App and ensure that they only access categories appropriate for their age. By allowing a minor to use this app, you acknowledge that they may be exposed to content intended for adults if appropriate category selections are not made. If you believe that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.</p>

        <!-- ... (Sections 7-9 remain the same, but ensure the contact details are correct) ... -->
